    <p class="des">Just like any other dog, there are some things you need to take 
        note of if you are considering acquiring an American Bully dog.
        For as lovable and even-tempered as the breed is, some factors, 
        such as health conditions and exercise requirements, go hand in 
        hand with owning an American bully
        </p> 
    </div>
    </div>

    <div class="des-grp-fl">
        <div class="des-grp">
            <h3 class="des-title">They May Be Prone to Obesity</h3>
            <p class="des">Unfortunately, due to their genetics and lineage, such as the Olde English Bulldog and American Bulldog, many American bullies may be more prone to obesity.
            <br>
            <br>
            Being stocky and short in frame can make it hard for owners to identify when their beloved bully is verging on obesity.
            <br>
            <br>
            As such, there is no breed standard for weight for the American bully. But what is known is that its weight should always be in proportion to its frame.
            <br>
            <br>
            This means the dog’s waist should be visible when you look at it from above and that the ribcage is not covered in too much fat.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="des-grp-fl">
    <div class="des-grp">
    <h3 class="des-title">They Need Lots of Exercise</h3>

        <p class="des">American Bullies are typically low-maintenance dogs but are moderately active, meaning they will require at least 60 minutes of exercise daily to keep them happy.
            And younger, more energetic dogs may require even more exercise-related activity.
        <br>
        <br>
        They especially love games of tug and fetch, which will give them a little more action and keep them on their toes.
        </p>
    </div>
        <div class="des-grp">
    <h3 class="des-title">They’re Prone to Joint Issues</h3>
        <p class="des">As mentioned previously, due to their muscular body and size, American bullies are more vulnerable to developing health issues as they age.
            <br>
            <br>
            Joint problems include hip dysplasia, where the ball and socket of the hip joint fail to fit snugly together, and elbow dysplasia, a congenital abnormality found predominantly in Pocket American Bully dogs.
        </p>
    </div>


    <div class="des-grp">
    <h3 class="des-title">They May Be Prone to Skin Allergies</h3>
        <p class="des">Another health issue associated with American bullies is that they are prone to developing allergies. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Common allergies include food, medications, and environmental factors such as pollen, mold, and fleas.
        </p>
    </div>

        <div class="des-grp">
    <h3 class="des-title">They Need Lots of Socialization</h3>
        <p class="des">The American bully breed dog is a naturally social animal that loves being around people.
            <br>
            <br>
            And as pack animals, it is essential that they learn how to socialize with other dogs and animals from a young age. 
            <br>
            <br>
            For if American bully puppies are not socialized from a young age on how to react in a healthy way, just like any other dog breed, they can develop undesirable behavioral issues such as aggression.

<h2 class="des-title">American Bully Dog Breed Health and Care</h2>


<div class="Img">
    <img width="50%" height="50%" src="../Dog/Dog-img-11.jpg" alt= "Dog-img-12" title="Dog-img-12.png"> 
    </div>
    <div class="des-grp-fl"> 
    <div class="des-grp">
<p class="des">While considered a low-maintenance dog breed, the American bully, like any other breed, is vulnerable to certain health problems that require proper 
    care in order for it to thrive and grow into a happy and healthy dog. </p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="des-grp-fl">
    <div class="des-grp">
    <h3 class="des-title">Diet</h3> 
    <p class="des">
    As the American bully is prone to hip dysplasia, it is essential that the dog is provided with the appropriate levels of exercise and that their food intake is monitored to prevent obesity, which is a contributing factor to this condition.
    These dogs need a balanced diet in order to remain in optimum health and not lapse into obesity which they are prone to.
    As such, an American Bully requires a high protein diet, and the dry kibbles made especially for the breed should contain high-quality food ingredients with a protein content of at least 30% and a fat content of 20%.
    When young, an American bully puppy begins forming its adult muscle structure, so it is recommended that they are fed up to two cups of kibbles three to four times a day.
    As the pups grow into adulthood, this feeding habit changes as the meal quantities increase to three to five cups of kibbles but only twice a day.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="des-grp">
    <h3 class="des-title">Eye issues</h3> 
    <p class="des">
    Unfortunately, they are also vulnerable to eye issues such as cherry eye, which appears as a large red obstruction in the eye. Another common disorder is ulcers on the cornea.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="des-grp">
    <h3 class="des-title">Skin issues</h3>
    <p class="des">
    Additionally, the American bully can also be prone to skin diseases such as seborrhea which results in excessively dry or oily skin, and eczema, which is characterized by dry, flaky patches of skin.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="des-grp">
    <h3 class="des-title">Grooming</h3>
    <p class="des">And they also lean towards developing hotspots resulting from parasites, allergies, or over-grooming.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="des-grp">
    <h3 class="des-title">Heart diseases</h3>
    <p class="des">
    Finally, American bullies can also be predisposed to congenital heart diseases, which are often genetic in origin. This condition can be made worse by obesity in the dog or the presence of parasites such as heartworm.
