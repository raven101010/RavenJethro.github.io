            <h2 class= "First-part-title">What are American bullies</h2>
            <p>A relatively new breed, the American bully breed is 
                fast gaining popularity, especially in the US, where 
                the dog breed originated from. With their characteristic 
                muscular body, heavy bone structure, and blocky head, 
                these impressive dogs are hard to miss.
                <br>
                <br>
            Yet their aggressive-looking appearance is deceiving.
                 For when bred correctly, American bullies are well-rounded 
                 dogs with a good-natured temperament, making them the perfect 
                 family dog. Affectionate by nature, these dogs are not only 
                 social animals with a zest for life who love being around 
                 people. They are also protective and loyal and generally 
                 tend to get along well with other dogs and animals.
                 <br>
                 <br>
            Because of their devoted personality, you will find that they 
                always aim to please and thrive on attention. And better yet, 
                make an intelligent guard dog of sorts, although they may be 
                more prone to licking the person to death than being aggressive.</p>

                <h2>History of the breeds</h2>
                <p>The American bully originated in the US between the 1980s 
                    and the 1990s.Created through years of selective breeding, 
                    the Bully carries the desired genetic traits of two dogs, 
                    the American Staffordshire terrier and the American Pitbull 
                    terrier.</p>

                <h2>American bully Family tree</h2> 
                <p>But it is also generally agreed that other breeds, such as 
                    the English bulldog, American bulldog, and the bull mastiff, 
                    have all contributed to the American Bully’s bloodline as 
                    well. It was not until 2004 that the American bully as a 
                    breed gained recognition with the establishment of the American 
                    Bully Kennel Club, which produced written standards for the 
                    breed. In 2013, the United Kennel Club also formally recognized 
                    the breed.However, to date, “American Kennel Club” still hasn’t 
                    recognized the American Bully or accepted it as a purebred dog 
                    on their registry.<p>
