            determined by its adult height. Males under 17" and no less than

            Important to note that Pocket Bully variety is simply shorter than 
            the Standard American Bully. Pocket Bully dogs share the same build, 
            body type, and breed type as the Standard American Bully, and are 
            not to be penalized for exhibiting heavily muscled, massive, bulky 
            body type.</p>

            <p class="Size-description">The American Bully should give the impression of great strength for 
            Its size. It is a compact and medium/large size dog with a muscular 
            body and blocky head. The American Bully should have the appearance 
            of heavy bone structure with a bulky build and look.
            <br>
            <br>
            The American Bully is a breed of dog that derives from the American 
            Pit Bull Terrier and the American Staffordshire Terrier. It is highly 
            suspected that various Bulldogs breeds were also used in It's creation 
            as well.
            <br>
            <br>
            The American Bully came to fruition because of a preference and a popular 
            desire to create something different than the standard written for the 
            above mentioned breeds. The breeders wanted more! More muscle, more bone, 
            more head, and an overall wow factor that was absent in some of the dogs 
            seen as the standard of the breeds in which it derived from.</p>

            <p class="Size-description">This is an amendment to the basic standard which a Classic Bully 
            is determined by its body structure and build. Both sex dogs 
            with lighter body frames and less overall body mass, but still 
            exhibiting "bully" traits.
            <br>
            <br>
            Example of Bully Traits - Blocky/heavy heads; short/square 
            muzzles; heavier bone, muscle, and compact body. Overall more 
            bone and substance than the modern and more "terrier type" American 
            Pit Bull Terrier and American Staffordshire Terrier.
            <br>
            <br>
            Classic Bully to give the appearance of bullier, old style American 
            Pit Bull Terriers and/or American Staffordshire Terrier, which 
            made up the origin of the American Bully.
            <br>
            <br>
            Classic Bully variety is simply an American Bully dog having lighter 
            body frames (lighter bone) and less overall body mass (less substance) 
            than the Standard American Bully. Aside from this difference, the 
            Classic Bully variety follows the same standard as the Standard American Bully.</p>

            <p class="Size-description">Often referred to as an "Exotic Bully", The Extreme American Bully is 
            a more exaggerated version of the Standard American Bully. The Extreme 
            American Bully carries more mass, girth, bone, and substance than the 
            Standard American Bully.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Exotic Bully is a spinoff of the American Bully. It is a breed that breeders have developed 
            out of creative expression, using the more overdone features of smaller bulldog 
            breeds like the French Bulldog, Shorty Bull and English Bulldog.</p>
